Slidedeck about [Sprinkle](https://github.com/sprinkle-tool/sprinkle), built with [reveal.js](lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

Since the time of writing, the author would highly recommend using [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) rather than Sprinkle, because it is much more actively maintained and has a richer feature set, without sacrificing simplicity.

It is also being publically hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://fatuhoku.github.com/sprinkle-revealjs-slidedeck/#/).
